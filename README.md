# ChatbotLee_Assignment

This Assignment is done by 2 team mates and me.

========= Introduction ============
In this assignment, a chatbot named 'Lee' is created to deliver useful weather information to visitors who intend to visit the popular cities in Malaysia. The priority keywords that the user is required to provide are the cities in Malaysia and the month in which they would like to go, and Lee will then deliver the information and suggestions based on these keywords. In addition, Lee provides some simple and helpful instructions at the beginning of the conversation to guide users, especially the first-time users. For example, based on the guide given, a user can simply type 'help' to check out how to use the chatbot and what the chatbot will be able to provide. Not only that, but Lee will also answer general questions such as, ‘What is a chatbot?’.
